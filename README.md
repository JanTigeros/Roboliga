# What is Roboliga?
Roboliga is a competition where students with knowledge of robotics and programming compete. To participate in the competition, students must make and program a robot that will be good enough to overcome the polygons set by the competition organizer with sensors and artificial intelligence. The winner is the robot who completes the polygon in the shortest time, but if there is no winner, the one who comes the longest wins.
